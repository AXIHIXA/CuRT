# CuRT

- CUDA Ray Tracing Demo. 
  - In One Weekend. 
- Inspired by and credits to: 
  - [RayTracing/raytracing.github.io](https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io);
  - [rogerallen/raytracinginoneweekendincuda](https://github.com/rogerallen/raytracinginoneweekendincuda). 
- Makes use of some more CUDA/C++ libraries to make life easier:
  - glm: OpenGL Mathematics (for device vec3 at present);
  - OpenCV: For framebuffer display;
  - Thrust: Easier memory management.
